# Hi, I'm Austen ðŸ‘‹

{{< intro img="/img/me.jpg" >}}

I'm a software engineer living in Huntsville, where I work in. I'm originally
from Massachusetts, but I grew up in Coosa County, Alabama. I studied aerospace
engineering at Auburn University, and participated in NASA's USLI and Spaceport
America competitions. There I was heavily involved with the electronics and
programming on the team, and it's where got my feet wet in the electronics
world.
