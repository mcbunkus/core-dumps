# Hi, I'm Austen ðŸ‘‹

{{< intro img="me.jpg" >}}

I'm a software engineer living in Huntsville. I'm originally from Massachusetts,
but I grew up in Coosa County, Alabama. I studied aerospace engineering at
Auburn University, and participated in NASA's USLI and Spaceport America
competitions. I've always been a tinkerer, but my tinkering really took off
here. I also enjoy playing a little guitar here and there, a good documentary,
and a good chess game. :)
