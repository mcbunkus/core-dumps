# Core dumps?

A core dump is a recorded state of a computer program at a specific point in
time, usually when it crashes. They're snapshots of what the computer was
"thinking" about when it crashed. This blog is a collection of my core dumps,
everything that's in my heart and on my mind. It's an open journal for my
friends and family to read, about my thoughts, desires, and adventures. In other words, a place for me to shamelessly yap as much as I want.
