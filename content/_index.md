## Hi, I'm Austen ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software developer living in Huntsville, I'm originally from Massachusetts, but I grew up in Alabama and went to high school at Coosa County Central. I studied aerospace engineering at Auburn University, and I was a part of the USLI rocket team for a few years. There I was heavily involved with the electronics and programming on the team, and it's where got my feet wet in the electronics world.

I also took an interest in game development a few years ago, and I've picked my way through some small projects. There's a lot of unfinished games and ideas, but I've been gaining more experience and getting further and further as time goes on. I have some big plans brewingâ€¦

Also, feel free take a look at my [projects](projects/)! I like to info dump about things I'm working on there, for future reference, and to share it with anyone who's interested. I'll write about anything I learn there, you might find it useful!
