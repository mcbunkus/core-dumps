You don't realize you're aging until something happens that makes you go "oh
yeah, this happens when you reach that age". Your friends from college, who you
haven't seen since you graduated, getting married is one such thing.

I can only describe Jm in Hunter S. Thompson's words: _There he goes, one of
God's own prototypes. A high-powered mutant of some kind never even considered
for mass production._ He works hard and parties harder, and he can make friends
with anyone. I'm not the type of person you'd normally find in his retinue, but
I'm his friend nonetheless. He's a good dude.

He got married this weekend in Mobile to his college sweetheart. I've never
really met her but once, but it's readily apparent that they're a perfect match.
I'm really happy for them, and I'm really thankful that I got to be there for
their wedding. Photos were understandably not allowed during the ceremony, so I
might have to come back and rip some from him (with his permission of course) to
post for y'all to see.

But I do have some pictures to share! Before I left for Huntsville, I visited
the USS Alabama Battleship Memorial Park. Everyone who knows me knows it's no
secret I _loooove_ airplanes, and I like old things. There's plenty of that to
see there.

Planes are the first thing you see when you walk in:

But this is the memorial park for the _USS Alabama..._ there's more to see
outside. But real quick, there's something interesting right out the door:

This is the first ever combat submarine to sink a warship, dating _all the way
back_ to the Civil War. Men crammed inside and turned a crank to spin the
propeller.
